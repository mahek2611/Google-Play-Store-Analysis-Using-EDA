The "Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Google Play Store Dataset" project involves analyzing data from the Google Play Store to uncover insights and patterns that can guide app development and marketing strategies. 
Utilizing Python for data analysis and visualization, the project begins with loading the dataset into a Python environment using Pandas. Data cleaning involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing fields. 
The data is then transformed to facilitate analysis, including creating new features if necessary. EDA is conducted to identify trends and patterns, such as the distribution of apps across categories, the relationship between ratings and variables like installs and price, and the popularity of free vs. paid apps. 
Visualizations are created using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly, with charts like histograms, bar plots, and scatter plots to represent findings. The project utilizes Python, Jupyter Notebook, and various data visualization libraries to provide a comprehensive understanding of
the Google Play Store landscape, aiding stakeholders in making informed decisions.
